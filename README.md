# Advent of Code

This repository contains all of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions! Every year has its own directory.

These solutions aren't the best, but that's fine! I'm not trying to make the best code, just having some fun.

## Goals

My goals for each year are:

- Complete each days puzzle
- Use a different language for each year
- Win over my friends on our private leaderboard
- Have a bunch of fun
- Maybe learn something new

## 2023

My first year doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), it was so fun I decided to do it again! This year I choose to write the solutions in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). However, I did not complete every puzzle this year.

### Usage

In order to run this years code you need node.

To install all the dependencies, run: `npm i`

Choose what day you want to run where n is the day.

**Linux/MacOS:** `npm run day:sh n`

**Windows:** `npm run day:ps n`

## 2024

Welcome to my second year! This year I'm writting the solutions in [Go](https://go.dev/). This time, I'm planning to complete every days puzzle.

### Usage

To run this years code, you need to have Go installed. 

Open any days directory where n is the day: `cd 2024/day-n`

Run the code with: `go run .`
